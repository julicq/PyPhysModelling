1. We need to simulate the uniform motion of a ball on a plane.

2. Let's add the elastic bouncing of the ball off the walls on the screen.

3. Then we'll add gravity force (we will recalculate the speed, not the coordinates).

4. Changing the model: the motion of a material point in the field of central forces.
